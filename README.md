#Foodgasm# aka ##Dinner Party Meal Planner##


##Objective##
The final project for the WDI course at General Assembly should be a full stack application of our choosing. 
The idea behind this application came from personal experience. My friends all seem to be indecisive about what they want to eat. Whenever a dinner party is organized, it's an ordeal figuring out who will cook what, who can eat what, and what everyone wants. My solution was a web app where a dinner party can be created, members can add themselves, and they can all vote on what they want to eat. 

##Tech Stuff##
This app was built using Ruby on Rails and the following technologies:
* Javascript
* jQuery
* AJAX
* PostgreSQL
* HTML/CSS
* Semantic UI
* bcrypt

##API##
Shoutout to the folks at Yummly who gave me a student account so I didn't have to pay. Pulled recipes from their API so users could save the ones they like.

##Deployment##
Deployed on Heroku at still-crag-3745.herokuapp.com

##Database##


##Word Cloud##
Used this great ruby gem and jQuery plug in for the word cloud
