##Dinner Party Assistsant##

##Objective##
The final project for the WDI course at General Assembly should be a full stack application of our choosing. 
The idea behind this application came from personal experience. My friends all seem to be indecisive about what they want to eat. Whenever a dinner party is organized, it's an ordeal figuring out who will cook what, who can eat what, and what everyone wants. My solution was a web app where a dinner party can be created, members can add themselves, and they can all vote on what they want to eat. 

##Tech Stuff##
This app was built using Ruby on Rails and the following technologies:
Javascript
jQuery
AJAX
PostgreSQL
HTML/CSS
Semantic UI
bcrypt

##API##
Shoutout to the folks at Yummly who gave me a student account so I didn't have to pay.

application up and running.

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization
